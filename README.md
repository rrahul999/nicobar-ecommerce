Create a SPA with reference to this 
It should contain a header, footer, main body, side menu (for filters).

Note: Header, footer, main body, side menu should be all in different components.

Point to remember: 
1. Filters should be working

2. Once user clicks on any product he should be redirected to this page, Here the user can select the size and the item to the bag.

3. item can not be added to the bag until the user does not selects any size.
4. After adding an item to bag, a popup should come just like the website.
5. New page should not open in a new tab.
